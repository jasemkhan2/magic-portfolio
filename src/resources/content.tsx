        I'm an XR designer, game developer and creative technologist specializing in immersive experiences that blur the line between digital and physical worlds. Iâ€™ve completed a graduate degree in Information Technology spec. Gaming, AR and VR at Algoma University, with hands-on experience building games and experiences for Console, VR, MR, and real-time 3D. I design virtual worlds that arenâ€™t just seen, theyâ€™re felt. From high-intensity VR sports simulations to psychological experiences where motion itself is a mechanic, I love exploring how space, sound, interaction, and story come together in immersive design.
        ðŸ§ What I focus on:
        Spatial storytelling & user experience in VR/MR
        Interaction systems, Blueprint/C# scripting & custom mechanics
        Real-time 3D environments (Unreal Engine, Unity, Twinmotion, Spatial.io)
        Performance-aware design for Oculus/Meta Quest & WebXR
        Collaborative prototyping with cross-functional teams
        
        Iâ€™ve built projects ranging from Olympic VR games to ambient tension-based simulations to confidential Spatial.io experiences; all with an eye toward emotion, interaction, and impact. If you're building something in XR, immersive media, or creative tech, let's connect. Iâ€™m always up for pushing boundaries, one headset at a time!
        In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, going to the gym, and exploring restaurants & cafes around Toronto.
